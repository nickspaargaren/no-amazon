# Definition of GAFAM

*The GAFAM is an acronym used to describe the five multinational technology companies Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft, taking the first letters of all these companies. The GAFAM are sometimes referred to as the Big Five due to them being the five most profilific companies in the world. Although in some sectors some of the five companies may be in direct competition, they offer different products or services overall while presenting some common characteristics that deserve to bring them together under the same acronym: by their size, they are particularly influential on the American and European Internet both economically and politically and socially and are regularly the subject of criticism or prosecution on tax matters, abuses of dominant positions and the non-respect of Internet users' privacy.*

# Purge Amazon from your network!

Protect yourself from Amazon monopoly by using this blocklist!

To aid in completing the GAFAM PiHole list, here is a list of known Amazon related trackers/spyware.

Note: Some items on the list may break some websites/services so please be prepared to edit/whitelist as needed.

## Warning for Fire TV Stick Users

If you block the domains `fireoscaptiveportal.com` and `firetvcaptiveportal.com`, your Fire TV Stick may repeatedly crash on the home screen, complaining about a lack of network connectivity. Restarting the device will not resolve the issue.

### Solution
Unblock the domains `fireoscaptiveportal.com` and `firetvcaptiveportal.com` to allow the Fire TV Stick to boot properly. This will still block other Amazon-related domains and ads while ensuring the device functions as expected.

### Reason
These domains are essential for the Fire TV Stick to establish network connectivity during startup. Blocking them prevents the device from functioning correctly. If you use the Fire TV Stick solely for local media playback (e.g., via VLC and a local NAS), unblocking these domains should not pose any privacy concerns.

### Note
While avoiding GAFAM devices is ideal, practical constraints may necessitate their use. This solution balances functionality with privacy.
